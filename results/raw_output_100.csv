 The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormalities are present. 
 Thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures are unremarkable.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates
 are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area on the frontal view.  Skeletal

 post bilateral thoracocentesis, now with increased shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for possible reaccumulation of pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained on ___.  On the preceding examination, the reduction
 of the right-sided lower densities were indicative of successful right-sided
 thoracocentesis in comparison with a chest examination of ___.  The
 left-sided base did not show any significant interval change.  No evidence of
 apical pneumothorax was found on either side.  Position of left-sided PICC
 line was unremarkable.  On the present portable chest examination, pulmonary
 vascular congestive pattern has increased again.  There is now an increasing
 haze on the right base suggestive of some increased pleural effusion probably
 layering in the posterior pleural compartments as the patient is in semi-erect
 position only.  On the left base, increasing diaphragmatic contour haze exists
 and most likely the patient developed again bilateral pleural effusions.  A
 lateral view could better answer the question if significant pleural effusion
 exists requiring renewed thoracocentesis.  No pneumothorax is identified on
 the present examination.","as compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. no evidence of pneumonia, no pulmonary edema. normal lung volumes. no evidence of pneumonia. borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. at the time of dictation and observation, 1 : 23 p. m., on _ _ _, the referring physician,"

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with intra-aortic balloon
 pump placement and Swan catheter placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 07:32 a.m.
 
 The intra-aortic balloon pump tip is lower, located approximately 2.8 cm below
 the roof of the aortic arch.  The Swan-Ganz catheter inserted through the
 femoral approach terminates what appears to be  left lower lobe pulmonary
 artery.  Surrounding opacity might reflect pulmonary edema, but in part may be
 die to pulmonary infarct due to too deep position of the intra-arterial
 catheter. 
 
 Pulmonary edema, bilateral right more than left pleural effusions are
 unchanged. Infectious process, as part of the left perihilar opacity is a
 possibility,  and attention to this area is required.","right - sided internal jugular venous catheter tip terminates in the mid svc, unchanged. subcutaneous emphysema is again noted on the left. there is mild to moderate pulmonary edema. there is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax. the cardiac size is top normal. a right - sided picc line ends in"

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  The heart size is normal.  No
 configuration abnormality is identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  Appearance of thoracic aorta is unremarkable.  Mediastinal

 and multiple penetrating fixation screws into the vertebral bodies covering
 the entire thoracic and upper portion of the lumbar spine.  The orthopedic
 hardware appears unchanged in position.  No new pulmonary parenchymal

 there is some local thickening of the left-sided interlobar fissure most
 likely representing postoperative scar formations.  No gross changes in

 HISTORY:  Infiltrate seen on x-ray earlier this month with some chest
 congestion. Rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are increased bibasilar opacities, left greater than right. There is
 blunting of the right posterior costophrenic angle, likely related to pleural
 fluid. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited by overlying opacities.
 Upper lungs are well aerated.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Left greater than right bibasilar opacities, potentially due to
 atelectasis, a component of infection, although chronic process is also
 possible. Correlation with priors would be helpful. Repeat evaluation is
 recommended upon completion of treatment.
 
 2. Right sided pleural effusion.",patient is status post median sternotomy. cardiac silhouette size is unchanged and top normal. mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. pulmonary vasculature is normal. minimal atelectasis is seen in the left lower lung without new focal consolidation. no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. no acute osseous abnormalities seen.
